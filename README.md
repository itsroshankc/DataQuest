# DataQuest
In this data science project, "DataQuest: Exploring Football, Game of Thrones, and Wine," I'll dive into hands-on exercises to analyze football and Game of Thrones datasets.
Additionally, I'll learn predictive analytics using wine data.
The journey will provide insights into real-world problem-solving and empower me with a strong foundation in data science. 
I'm excited to work on my very first data science adventure with DataQuest! 🚀📈🏈🍷
